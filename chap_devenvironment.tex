In order to write code we must have a development environment. There are many sollutions to do this. Some can be as simple as having a text editor and a command line compiler and linker program. Another solution is to install a Integrated Development Environment (IDE). One of the most popular IDE's for C++ development is Visual Studio Community. Visual Studio Community is free and can be downloaded from the web. For those who can not use visual studio community we will also explain how to use Visual Studio Code which is also free but runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. In this chapter we will explain how to install Visual Studio Community or Visual Studio Code as an IDE and will provide you instruction on how to make a basic Hello World Application.
